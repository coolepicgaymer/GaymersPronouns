undefined-pronouns: "Not set"

# ---------------------------------------- #
#
# How do I add more pronouns?
#
# You can add more pronouns simply by doing some copy pasting or editing the existing ones.
#
# You can also easily make new ones in-game using the "/gp pronouns" command if you find this overwhelming.
#
#
#
# Here's the format:
#                               This is the pronoun ID. It's not visible to players in-game and is only used for saving purposes. This also
#                               means that if you were to edit or swap around these numbers below, that players with those pronouns would get
#  1:                       <-- different pronouns assigned to them, so don't do that. Note that the pronouns are shown in the order of
#                               their IDs from low to high. Positive numbers are shown on the left side of the pronoun picker, and negative
#                               numbers on the right side. Do not use 0 as it is reserved.
#
#   hidden: false           <-- Whether you want to hide it from the picker menu for some reason. It can still be manually assigned by admins.
#
#   display: "They/Them"    <-- This is how it's displayed when it's the only picked pronouns of a player. This is the only required attribute.
#
#   dominant: "They"        <-- This is the dominant pronoun used when it's in a set of multiple pronouns (e.g. She/They). If not specified, the first
#                               part of the display attribute will be used (in this case, "They", which would make this redundant, hence its rare use).
#
#   subjective: "They"      <-- The subjective pronoun. (e.g. He, She, They)
#   objective: "Them"       <-- The objective pronoun. (e.g. Him, Her, Them)
#   possessive: "Their"     <-- The possessive pronoun. (e.g. His, Her, Their)
#   reflexive: "Themselves" <-- The reflexive pronoun. (e.g. Himself, Herself, Themselves)
#
#   verb: "Are"             <-- The verb associated with the pronoun (e.g. "Is", "Are" to be used in placeholders like "He *is*", "They *are*").
#
#
#
#   This seems like a lot. But if you don't use PlaceholderAPI (which most probably don't), you only really need the ID and the display.
#   In some cases the 'dominant' is also useful when the first pronoun in the x/y format isn't the one you want displayed when multiple sets are shown together.
#   Hiding pronouns may be useful if a set of pronouns is being abused somehow (can still be assigned with /gp assign).

  # There's not any deep reason for skipping 5 here. It's just because some languages have more pronouns so you can change between them without messing up your players' saved pronouns or having a weird order of displaying them in.
