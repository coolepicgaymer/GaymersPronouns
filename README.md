# Gaymer's Pronouns
A simple, yet very customizable Minecraft plugin that adds pronouns.

Pick your pronouns with a fancy looking GUI, and display them in any way you want it. Natively supports putting it in chat or the tablist. Can also be put anywhere else by using PlaceholderAPI.

There are a whole load of comments in the config file, making the configuration easy, even if you're a beginner.
